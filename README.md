# Tabs Manager 101

## Quick Start

Two terminals are needed.

For live compiling the Scala.js code:

 ```
 sbt "~fastLinkJS"
 ```

For the frontend server:

 ```
 npm start
 ```

### See extension running

Go to your browser, and load an unpacked extension from the `dist` folder.

### See as a web page

Navigate to http://localhost:1234/ to see your site running on a browser page.

Useful for testing the UI, functionality limited due to the lack of the browser API, you can use dummy data to see it in
the UI.
